### Hi/bonjour :raised_hand:

- :evergreen_tree: I'm Nick, a web developer, as you doubtless could have guessed.
- :pencil: I primarily work in the LAMP stack and SCSS/CSS/JS/jQuery, but I also dabble in React and Svelte.
- :hourglass_flowing_sand: The sands of time flow onward, so we must strive to maintain, clean, refactor, build!
