### Hi/bonjour :raised_hand:

- :evergreen_tree: I'm Nick, a web developer. In the last several months, I've been working with the LAMP stack and JS/jQuery. Windows/Linux.
- :pencil: Currently getting into the study of Vue (which is very nice, so far). I don't want to get stuck in old tech.
- :hourglass_flowing_sand: The work for my most recent position was all on GitLab, so you won't see that here.
