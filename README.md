### Hi/bonjour :raised_hand:

- :evergreen_tree:  I'm Nick, a web developer. My preference is front-end, but I do some back-end as well.
- :pencil:  Primary languages I've been using these days: HTML/CSS/JS/PHP/SQL. Currently learning React.
- :hourglass_flowing_sand: Most of my recent work has been small personal projects, my website, online courses, and school projects.
