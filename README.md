### Hi/bonjour :raised_hand:

- :evergreen_tree:  I'm Nick, a web developer. My preference is front-end, but I do some back-end as well.
- :pencil:  Primary languages I've been using these days: HTML/CSS/JS/PHP/SQL. Currently learning TypeScript and React.
- :hourglass_flowing_sand: Most of my recent work has been in the form of small personal projects, school projects, my website, and online courses.
