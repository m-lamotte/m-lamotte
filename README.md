### Hi/bonjour :raised_hand:

- :evergreen_tree: I'm Nick, a web developer. These days I work primarily with the LAMP stack and JS/jQuery. Windows/Linux.
- :pencil: Currently getting back into the study of React. The goal is to become more versatile in front-end.
- :hourglass_flowing_sand: A lot of my work these days is on GitLab, so you won't see that here. Perhaps I'll get around to building a nice game of chess.
