### Hi/bonjour :raised_hand:

- :evergreen_tree: Hello! My name is Nicholas, and I'm a web developer :: back-end and front-end development.
- :scroll: Primarily experienced in the WordPress space (LAMP), I tend to work with PHP, SQL, HTML, CSS/Sass, JavaScript/jQuery, and React, but I dabble in several other languages and frameworks. Currently messing around in TypeScript.
