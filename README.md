### Hello, bonjour! :wave:

- :deciduous_tree: My name is Nick (Nicholas), and I'm a web developer :: back-end and front-end development.
- :computer: Primarily experienced in WordPress, PHP, SQL, HTML, CSS/Sass, JavaScript/jQuery (and a bit of React).
- :newspaper: I also like to dabble in writing, editing, and proofreading (e.g. copywriting, copyediting, and technical writing).

> Just a note that most of my repositories are **private** and thus not visible. These are typically codebases for courses and they don't really serve any useful function in terms of showcasing my abilities. The exception is my personal website, which is a simple project and I have made that private as well.

> The few that are publically available are fairly out-of-date. I would suggest looking at any **pinned** posts for examples of my non-work-related development projects!
